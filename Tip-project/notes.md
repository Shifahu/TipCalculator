1. create the template of the app without any styling 
2. so we have an input bar that only accepts number, which would be the bill amount
3. we have another input that has number of people
4. we have the different percentages which would perform their own seperate calculations, I would make this a prop so I just need to pass in the 
5. there is a custom input which would be an input bar too.
6. the results of this operation would be rendered as the tip amount per person and then the final bill would be calculated also


calculator and the input would be the children (static), the logic should be in the main app
